# Summary of Implementation

We have successfully implemented a Ktor-based web application for performance testing of JDKs. Here's what we've accomplished:

1. Set up a Kotlin/Ktor project with all necessary dependencies
2. Configured the application for optimal performance
3. Implemented various endpoints for testing different aspects of performance:
   - CPU-intensive operations (prime calculation, sorting, matrix multiplication)
   - Memory-intensive operations (object allocation, collection manipulation, string manipulation)
   - I/O-intensive operations (file operations, simulated database and network operations)
   - Configurable endpoints with variable response sizes and delays
4. Added metrics collection using Prometheus
5. Configured logging with Logback
6. Set up the application to be built as a fat JAR for deployment to AWS EC2
7. Created comprehensive documentation with instructions for building, running, and testing the application

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation, you should:

1. Build and run the application locally:
   ```
   ./gradlew run
   ```

2. Test the application with the wrk tool as described in the README.md

3. Deploy the application to AWS EC2 for benchmarking different JDKs

The application is now ready for performance testing and benchmarking of different JDKs.
