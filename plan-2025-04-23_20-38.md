# Plan for Ktor Performance Testing Application

## Project Overview
Create a Ktor-based web application designed for performance testing of different JDKs. The application will be optimized for measuring latency, throughput, and memory consumption. It will leverage Kotlin coroutines for handling high concurrency and will be deployable as a fat JAR for local testing and AWS EC2 deployment.

## High-Level Approach

1. **Project Setup**
   - Configure Gradle build system with necessary dependencies
   - Set up the application structure following Ktor best practices
   - Configure logging for performance monitoring

2. **Core Application Development**
   - Implement the main application module
   - Configure server settings for optimal performance
   - Set up routing for various test endpoints

3. **Performance Testing Endpoints**
   - Create CPU-intensive endpoints (computation, sorting, etc.)
   - Create memory-intensive endpoints (object allocation, collection manipulation)
   - Create I/O-intensive endpoints (file operations, database operations if needed)
   - Implement endpoints with varying response sizes and processing times

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Configure coroutines for optimal concurrency
   - Implement connection pooling if using external resources
   - Add metrics collection endpoints for monitoring application performance

5. **Documentation and Testing**
   - Add comprehensive comments throughout the code
   - Create documentation for running and testing the application
   - Ensure the application can be built as a fat JAR
   - Test the application locally with the wrk tool

6. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Configure the application for easy deployment to AWS EC2
   - Ensure proper configuration for different environments
